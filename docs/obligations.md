# Obligations

Obligations are the typed constraints Nomos applies after a policy decision matches an action.

They are part of the authorization result and MUST remain deterministic for the same normalized action, verified identity, policy bundle, and engine version.

## Core Rules

- obligations are evaluated only after normalization and policy matching
- obligations MUST be side-effect free to compute
- when multiple matching rules contribute obligations, Nomos resolves conflicts deterministically
- deny-wins semantics remain authoritative; obligations do not override a `DENY`

## Supported Obligation Types

- `sandbox_mode`
- `net_allowlist`
- `exec_allowlist`
- `http_redirects`
- `http_redirect_hop_limit`
- `output_max_bytes`
- `output_max_lines`
- `approval_scope_class`
- `credential_lease_ids`

## Deterministic Merge Rules

- LIMITS choose the most restrictive numeric value
- SANDBOX chooses the most restrictive profile by explicit ordering
- NET chooses the most restrictive mode (`deny > allowlist > open`)
- RATE limits choose the lowest limit
- TAGS form a union
- REDACTION rules form a union
- OUTPUT caps choose the smallest cap
- EXEC allowlists are intersected or otherwise reduced to the stricter effective set
- NET allowlists are intersected or otherwise reduced to the stricter effective set

## Execution Contract

- the policy engine returns obligations as data
- the service layer merges and exposes obligations with the decision
- executors enforce only the obligations relevant to their action type
- if the configured runtime cannot satisfy a required obligation, Nomos fails closed

## Testing Guidance

- add merge-behavior tests for any new obligation type
- keep obligation outputs stable for the same inputs
- avoid obligation logic that depends on wall-clock state, host state, or external services
